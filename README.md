# InterstellarBattalionSocialNetworking
An iOS application made for Software Engineering for IOS module at university.

The aim for the assignment was to create an IOS application for an upcoming film, Intersterllar Battalion. I decided to create
a twitter like clone. So the app allows you to post small messages and view other peoples posts. I achieved a 78% grade for this application.
